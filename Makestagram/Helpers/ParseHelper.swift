// We are going to wrap all of our helper methods into a class called ParseHelper. We only do this so that all of the functions are bundled under the ParseHelper namespace. That makes the code easier to read in some cases. To call the timeline request function you call ParseHelper.timelineRequestforUser... instead of simply timelineRequestforUser. That way you always know exactly in which file you can find the methods that are being called.

class ParseHelper {
    
    
// MARK: Likes
    static func likePost(user: PFUser, post: Post) {
        let likeObject = PFObject(className: ParseLikeClass)
        likeObject[ParseLikeFromUser] = user
        likeObject[ParseLikeToPost] = post
        
        likeObject.saveInBackgroundWithBlock(nil)
    }
    
    static func unlikePost(user: PFUser, post: Post) {
        // We build a query to find the like of a given user that belongs to a given post
        let query = PFQuery(className: ParseLikeClass)
        query.whereKey(ParseLikeFromUser, equalTo: user)
        query.whereKey(ParseLikeToPost, equalTo: post)

            (results: [AnyObject]?, error: NSError?) -> Void in
            // We iterate over all like objects that met our requirements and delete them.
            if let results = results as? [PFObject] {
                for likes in results {
                    likes.deleteInBackgroundWithBlock(nil)
                }
            }

        query.whereKey(ParseLikeToPost, equalTo: post)
        // We are using the includeKey method to tell Parse to fetch the PFUser object for each of the likes (we've discussed includeKey in detail when building the timeline request). Otherwise, just reference.
        query.includeKey(ParseLikeFromUser)

    // We mark this method as static. This means we can call it without having to create an instance of ParseHelper - you should do that for all helper methods. This method has only one parameter, completionBlock: the callback block that should be called once the query has completed. The type of this parameter is PFArrayResultBlock. That's the default type for all of the callbacks in the Parse framework. By taking this callback as a parameter, we can call any Parse method and return the result of the method to that completionBlock - you'll see how we use that in 3.

    static func timelineRequestforCurrentUser(completionBlock: PFArrayResultBlock) {
        let followingQuery = PFQuery(className: ParseFollowClass)

        postsFromFollowedUsers!.whereKey(ParsePostUser, matchesKey: ParseFollowToUser, inQuery: followingQuery)
        
        let postsFromThisUser = Post.query()
        postsFromThisUser!.whereKey(ParsePostUser, equalTo: PFUser.currentUser()!)

        query.includeKey(ParsePostUser)
        query.orderByDescending(ParsePostCreatedAt)
        
        // The entire body of this method is unchanged, it's the exact timeline query that we've built within the TimelineViewController. The only difference is the last line of the method. Instead of providing a closure and handling the results of the query within this method, we hand off the results to the closure that has been handed to use through the completionBlock parameter. This means, whoever calls the timelineRequestforCurrentUser method will be able to handle the result returned from the query!
